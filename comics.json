He's particularly attached to Yoo Joonghyuk, the hero of Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse, and through his character, he's experienced the harrowing difficulties of time regression and the struggle to survive dangerous scenarios imposed on individuals by god-like entities known as Constellations. Dokja devotes himself to the novel and reads all 3,149 chapters, outlasting his peers who lost interest long before. Despite his disappointment in the story's conclusion, he receives a cryptic message from the author warning of future monetization before his surroundings turn pitch black, and he soon realizes he's living the novel's reality. As the only omniscient reader of the book's events, he's uncertain of his success in navigating the challenges to come, but he may now have the opportunity to embrace the protagonist he never felt suited for.",
